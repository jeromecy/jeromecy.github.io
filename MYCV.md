#### Shinyapp

##### 1. Yield Response Curves (YRC) project
* The *Yield Response Curves (YRC) project (DAW00245)* was a national collaboration initiated by the Grains Research and Development Corporation to deliver quantitative information on wheat and barley variety yield response to disease, as mediated by variety resistance. The main project outputs describe the relationships between yield and disease (yield response curves) for a range of resistance classes under a range of disease pressures. The project prioritised regionally important pathogens.

* This site has been designed to enable access to a comprehensive series of experiments, conducted throughout the course of the project, in the form of multi-environment trial (MET) analysed results summaries presented using `ShinyR` data visualisation. Results by disease can be viewed at a high level and also drilled down into further detail, as required by the user. The visualisation tools enable users to compare analysed results dynamically for ease of interpretation and to export the depicted relationships in the form of screen shots of graphs or tables.

* *The project partners included Department of Primary Industries and Regional Development Western Australia; Department of Agriculture and Fisheries, Queensland; Agriculture Victoria, Victoria; Department of Primary Industries, New South Wales.*

* The APP is at [https://zhanglong.shinyapps.io/Demo/](https://zhanglong.shinyapps.io/Demo)

##### 2. Crop Protection Analytics System
* The *Crop Protection Analytics System*. This APP is jointly developed by CCDM and SAGI West. It enables rapid and consistent analysis of the economics associated with disease impacts.

* The App is written with a few packages, including `shinydashboard`, `shinyWidgets`, `highcharter`, etc. It is not open to public until further decision.


##### 3. GRDC Disease and Pest Impact Overview

* A visualisation tool of disease and pest impact on crop yield and profits.
