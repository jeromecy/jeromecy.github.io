title: Good PP check and R square but large Pareto k values

Recently, I encountered a problem with using PSIS and Pareto k for model diagnostics and selection. Some models have good posterior predictive checking performance but a few terrible Pareto k values. And sometimes, a model with more high k values might be misspecified.
