There is no doubt on the importance of randomisation in agricultural experiments by agronomists and biometricians. Even when agronomists extend the experimentation from small trials to large on-farm trials, randomised designs predominate over systematic designs at most times.

However, the situation maybe changed depending on the objective of the on-farm experiments (OFE). If the goal of OFE is obtaining a smooth map showing the optimal level of a controllable input across a grid made by rows and columns covering the whole field, a systematic design should be preferred over a randomised design in terms of robustness and reliability.

With the novel geographically weighted regression (GWR) for OFE and simulation studies, we conclude that, for large OFE strip trials, the difference between randomised designs and systematic designs are not significant if the assumption is linear response and the spatial variation is not taken into account. However, systematic designs are superior to randomised designs if the assumption of the response is quadratic.
