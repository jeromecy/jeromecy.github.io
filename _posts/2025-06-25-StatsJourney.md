I'm excited to share a new project I've been working on — **Stats Journey**, an interactive learning platform for statistics and data science!

This platform is designed for students, researchers, and professionals who want to build a deep understanding of statistical concepts through intuitive visualisations and real-time simulations. It’s built with modern web technologies like React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and more.

I created this platform because I believe statistics should be accessible to everyone. Instead of memorising formulas, learners can explore concepts interactively and see how changes in parameters affect outcomes instantly.

It is under development for more functions and features.

### Website: StatsJourney[https://www.statsjourney.com]

### Features:
- 📊 Interactive visualisations
- ⚡ Real-time calculations
- 🎓 Comprehensive coverage from basic stats to machine learning
- 🌐 Built with React, Vite, and other modern tools

Whether you're just starting out or diving into advanced topics like Bayesian inference or time series analysis, StatsJourney has something for you.

Feel free to explore and share your feedback!
