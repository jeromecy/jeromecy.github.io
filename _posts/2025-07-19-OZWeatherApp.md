## Overview

OZWeatherApp is an interactive Shiny web application that visualises Australian weather and climate data, powered by advanced AI analysis. Leveraging the `{weatherOz}` package, the app accesses and downloads data from key Australian sources, including:

- **SILO**: Scientific Information for Land Owners ‚Äì Australia-wide gridded climate data from Queensland's Long Paddock initiative
- **DPIRD**: Department of Primary Industries and Regional Development ‚Äì Observational data from WA weather stations via the Weather 2.0 Open API

The app also supports integration with the Australian Government Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) for bulletins and imagery.

## Features

- üåç **Interactive Map**: Click anywhere to select a location and retrieve weather data (default: Perth)
- üìÖ **Date Range Selection**: Filter historical data by custom date ranges
- üìä **Data Visualisation**: Interactive charts for temperature and rainfall
- üìã **Enhanced Data Table**: Responsive, searchable, and sortable tables
- üì• **Export Options**: Download data as CSV, Excel, or PDF
- ü§ñ **AI Analysis**: Generate expert agricultural and meteorological insights using GPT-4o Mini or DeepSeek
- üé® **Modern UI**: Clean, responsive design with Australian spelling and branding
- üì± **Mobile Friendly**: Works seamlessly on desktop and mobile

## AI Analysis Capabilities

OZWeatherApp includes advanced AI-powered features:

- **Expert Analysis**: AI models provide professional agricultural and meteorological insights
- **Crop Disease Assessment**: Advice on fungicide application and crop disease risk
- **Weather Pattern Forecasting**: Predictions based on historical data trends
- **Streaming Results**: Real-time display of AI analysis with typewriter effect
- **Multiple AI Models**: Support for GPT-4o Mini and DeepSeek

## Data Sources

OZWeatherApp uses the `{weatherOz}` package to access data from:

- **DPIRD**: WA weather station network via the Weather 2.0 Open API
- **SILO**: Australia-wide gridded climate data
- **BOM**: Agriculture bulletins, radar and satellite imagery, and seven-day forecasts

## API Usage

The app integrates with third-party APIs (SILO, DPIRD, OpenAI, DeepSeek) for analytics and visualisation.  
**Online Demo**: Uses a temporary API key for demonstration.  
**Local Use**: Users must provide their own API keys. See below for setup instructions.
