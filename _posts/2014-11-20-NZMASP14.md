The New Zealand Maths and Stats Postgraduates Conference 2014 where I gave a presentation in English for the first time. It was a big challenge for me, and I really enjoy it!  

Lovely postgraduates, professional presentations, and enjoyable travel in Auckland with these young professionals!

This work is from my master study when I was at University of Shanghai for Science and Technology in 2010.
