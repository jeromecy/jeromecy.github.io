I"L<p>I’m excited to share a new project I’ve been working on — <strong>Stats Journey</strong>, an interactive learning platform for statistics and data science!</p>

<p>This platform is designed for students, researchers, and professionals who want to build a deep understanding of statistical concepts through intuitive visualisations and real-time simulations. It’s built with modern web technologies like React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and more.</p>

<p>I created this platform because I believe statistics should be accessible to everyone. Instead of memorising formulas, learners can explore concepts interactively and see how changes in parameters affect outcomes instantly.</p>

<p>It is under development for more functions and features.</p>
