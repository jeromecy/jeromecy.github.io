To this day, this is the method of choice for cultivar registration trials conducted by official federal institutes.

Such trials are often conducted at a larger number of locations. It is not clear how comparable these two trial systems are. Our objective therefore was to compare the precision and accuracy of these two systems using yield data from both on-farm trials and from official on-station trials for winter oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.) across 8 yr.

Furthermore, based on 23 hybrid genotypes common to both datasets, we investigated the genetic correlation between systems and tested for genotype × system interaction effects. The results suggest that on-farm trials are comparable with on-station trials in terms of precision of a single plot, but that there are genotype × system interaction effects prohibiting the comparison of yield estimates for genotypes between systems.

@inproceedings{Griffin2008Spatial,
abstract = {A 3-year case study was undertaken of how North American farmers use yield monitors for on-farm trials in farm management decision making. Case study methods were used because relatively few farmers quantitatively analyze yield monitor data. At this early research stage, insufficient farm management information about the data was available to ask the right questions in a large-scale survey. In addition to the formal case study of farmers experienced at using yield monitors to collect on-farm trial data, the study evaluated the effect of yield monitor data quality on farm decisions. Two levels of yield data quality included standard output where the default settings of farm-level mapping software were accepted and where filtering of the data was undertaken. Results indicated that yield data quality affects farm management decisions. In addition, farmers receiving a spatial analysis of their on-farm trial data tended to use split-field designs instead of replicated split-planter designs. They were also more confident in their decisions than before participation in the spatial analysis project, and made decisions more quickly. {\textcopyright}2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract = {Maximum likelihood or restricted maximum likelihood (REML) estimates of the parameters in linear mixed-effects models can be determined using the lmer function in the lme4 package for R. As for most model-fitting functions in R, the model is described in an lmer call by a formula, in this case including both fixed- and random-effects terms. The formula and data together determine a numerical representation of the model from which the profiled deviance or the profiled REML criterion can be evaluated as a function of some of the model parameters. The appropriate criterion is optimized, using one of the constrained optimization functions in R, to provide the parameter estimates. We describe the structure of the model, the steps in evaluating the profiled deviance or REML criterion, and the structure of classes or types that represents such a model. Sufficient detail is included to allow specialization of these structures by users who wish to write functions to fit specialized linear mixed models, such as models incorporating pedigrees or smoothing splines, that are not easily expressible in the formula language used by lmer.},

@article{Hurley2004Estimating,
abstract = {Confirming the precision agriculture hypothesis for variable-rate N applications (VRAs) is challenging. To confront this challenge, researchers have used increasingly sophisticated statistical models to estimate and compare site-specific crop response functions (SSCRFs). While progress has been made, it has been hampered by the lack of a conceptual framework to guide the development of appropriate statistical models. This paper provides such a framework and demonstrates its utility by developing a heteroscedastic, fixed and random effects, geostatistical model to test if VRA can increase N returns. The novelty of the model is the inclusion of site, spatial, treatment, and treatment strip heteroscedasticity and correlation. Applied to data collected in 1995 from two corn (Zea mays L.) N response experiments in south-central Minnesota, results demonstrate the importance of including site, spatial, treatment, and treatment strip effects in the estimation of SSCRFs. Results also indicate a significant potential for VRA to increase N returns and that these potential returns increase as the area of the management unit decreases. At one location, there was greater than a 95{\%} chance that VRA could have increased profitability if the cost of implementing VRA was less than {\$}14.5 ha -1. At the other location, if implementation costs were less than {\$}48.3 ha-1, there was greater than a 95{\%} chance of increased profitability.},

@article{Ritter2008AnOnfarm,
abstract = {Grain yield often varies within agricultural fields as a result of the variation in soil characteristics, competition from weeds, management practices and their causal interactions. To implement appropriate management decisions, yield variability needs to be explained and quantified. A new experimental design was established and tested in a field experiment to detect yield variation in relation to the variation in soil quality, the heterogeneity of weed distribution and weed control within a field. Weed seedling distribution and density, apparent soil electrical conductivity (ECa) and grain yield were recorded and mapped in a 3.5 ha winter wheat field during 2005 and 2006. A linear mixed model with an anisotropic spatial correlation structure was used to estimate the effect of soil characteristics, weed competition and herbicide treatment on crop yield. The results showed that all properties had a strong effect on grain yield. By adding herbicide costs and current grain price into the model, thresholds of weed density were derived for site-specific weed control. This experimental approach enables the variation of yield within agricultural fields to be explained, and an understanding of the effects on yield of the factors that affect it and their causal interactions to be gained. The approach can be applied to improve decision algorithms for the patch spraying of weeds. {\textcopyright} 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract = {Yield variation observed in soybean (Glycine max) progeny-row yield trial (PRYT) is the final result of line genotypic merit, field spatial pattern, and experimental error. The spatial variation in field tests could confound the estimates of genetic merits. The objectives of this research were to: i) quantify non-genetic yield variation in a soybean breeding PRYT, and ii) determine efficiency of the thin plate spline regression (TPSR) model in adjusting yield because of variation caused by field spatial pattern. The third objective was to evaluate if the use of TPSR model could improve the selection accuracy of PRYT un-replicated yield tests. Uniformity study, early generation test, and confirmation study were conducted. Our results indicated that large spatial variations in soybean PRYT field could be present as evaluated by the Uniformity Study conducted with two commercial lines. In this experiment, the use of the TPSR proved to be effective in reducing the error variance and the coefficient of variability, with an improvement in relative efficiency (IRE) of 37.9{\%}. In early generation tests, 2565 lines were evaluated within test-sets along with three checks. The TPSR model also was effective in the early-generation tests; the IRE was 40.4{\%}. The correlation coefficients calculated between yield estimates obtained in two-year early generation tests and confirmation study improved by 0.21 points compared with results from non-TPSR experiments. The results indicated that use of TPSR model was effective in accounting for some of the spatial variation in field tests.},

The purpose of this Monte Carlo simulation study was to examine the impact of estimation method (REML versus Bayesian with noninformative priors) on the estimation of treatment effects (relative bias, root mean square error) and on the inferences about those effects (interval coverage) for autocorrelated multiple-baseline data. Simulated conditions varied with regard to the number of participants, series length, and distribution of the variance within and across participants. REML and Bayesian estimation led to estimates of the fixed effects that showed little to no bias but that differentially impacted the inferences about the fixed effects and the estimates of the variances.

abstract = {Background: Geographically weighted regression (GWR) is a modelling technique designed to deal with spatial non-stationarity, e.g., the mean values vary by locations. It has been widely used as a visualization tool to explore the patterns of spatial data. However, the GWR tends to produce unsmooth surfaces when the mean parameters have considerable variations, partly due to that all parameter estimates are derived from a fixed- range (bandwidth) of observations. In order to deal with the varying bandwidth problem, this paper proposes an alternative approach, namely Conditional geographically weighted regression (CGWR). Methods: The estimation of CGWR is based on an iterative procedure, analogy to the numerical optimization problem. Computer simulation, under realistic settings, is used to compare the performance between the traditional GWR, CGWR, and a local linear modification of GWR. Furthermore, this study also applies the CGWR to two empirical datasets for evaluating the model performance. The first dataset consists of disability status of Taiwan's elderly, along with some social-economic variables and the other is Ohio's crime dataset. Results: Under the positively correlated scenario, we found that the CGWR produces a better fit for the response surface. Both the computer simulation and empirical analysis support the proposed approach since it significantly reduces the bias and variance of data fitting. In addition, the response surface from the CGWR reviews local spatial characteristics according to the corresponded variables. Conclusions: As an explanatory tool for spatial data, producing accurate surface is essential in order to provide a first look at the data. Any distorted outcomes would likely mislead the following analysis. Since the CGWR can generate more accurate surface, it is more appropriate to use it exploring data that contain suspicious variables with varying characteristics.},

abstract = {Modeling spatial interactions that arise in spatially referenced data is commonly done by incorporating the spatial dependence into the covariance structure either explicitly or implicitly via an autoregressive model. In the case of lattice (regional summary) data, two common autoregressive models used are the conditional autoregressive model (CAR) and the simultaneously autoregressive model (SAR). Both of these models produce spatial dependence in the covariance structure as a function of a neighbor matrix W and often a fixed unknown spatial correlation parameter. This paper examines in detail the correlation structures implied by these models as applied to an irregular lattice in an attempt to demonstrate their many counterintuitive or impractical results.

Studies have shown that heterosis decreased 25{\%}/50 yr, 10{\%}/60 yr, and 35{\%}/100 yr. Natural selection and artifi cial selection by plant breeders for adaptedness have increased parental inbred and hybrid seed yields, whereas percentage heterosis decreased. Four studies have shown inbred yields increased 1.9 to 3.5 times faster than heterosis yields. Pioneer HiBred generates 700 new inbreds tested in 6000 single-cross hybrids at 15 to 20 locations annually. Predicted, untested, newer hybrids are then made and tested extensively with commercial hybrids. Parental inbred yield testing is the next to last of several steps in hybrid development. Commercial hybrid development costs have increased logarithmically, whereas performance has increased linearly. Replacing preliminary testcross trials with fi nished-inbred yield trials is more effi cient. About 12,000 new fi nished inbreds can be evaluated annually with no testers and at least 50{\%} fewer locations per inbred with the same testing effort as 700 new inbreds with testers. A calendar year per breeding cycle and annual production costs for 6000 hybrids will be saved. Corn yield trials detect stress susceptibility, which is more apparent in inbreds than in hybrids. Evaluation of more new inbreds will be conducive to increased genetic diversity that produces higher-yielding hybrids. {\textcopyright} Crop Science Society of America.},

abstract = {Failure to account for spatially correlated errors when present in the classical randomized complete block (RCB) analysis may cause inefficient estimation of treatment significance. Covariance model selection is a necessary component for spatial adjustment to estimate treatment significance. We discuss methods for selecting a covariance model in RCB analyses in the presence of spatial correlation and demonstrate one procedure in detail. The procedure uses three models: the randomized complete block with independent and identically distributed errors (RCBiid), RCB with correlated errors, and models with correlated errors but no block effects. The semivariogram of the residuals from fitting a model with just fixed effects, the likelihood ratio test, and Akaike Information Criterion are used for model selection. To illustrate the procedure, we analyzed winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) forage and corn (Zea mays L.) grain yield in the presence of spatial heterogeneity within blocks from a site-specific N management study. We compared the selected covariance models to the RCBiid models and to other spatial models with respect to the estimation of treatment significance. The procedure can be extended to any experiment with fixed effects, or with both fixed and random effects, and which may potentially have spatially correlated errors. The procedure is systematic and readily implemented; however, it remains difficult to evaluate whether an adequate covariance model has been selected.},

@article{FDormann2007Methods,
abstract = {Species distributional or trait data based on range map (extent-of-occurrence) or atlas survey data often display spatial autocorrelation, i.e. locations close to each other exhibit more similar values than those further apart. If this pattern remains present in the residuals of a statistical model based on such data, one of the key assumptions of standard statistical analyses, that residuals are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d), is violated. The violation of the assumption of i.i.d. residuals may bias parameter estimates and can increase type I error rates (falsely rejecting the null hypothesis of no effect). While this is increasingly recognised by researchers analysing species distribution data, there is, to our knowledge, no comprehensive overview of the many available spatial statistical methods to take spatial autocorrelation into account in tests of statistical significance. Here, we describe six different statistical approaches to infer correlates of species' distributions, for both presence/absence (binary response) and species abundance data (poisson or normally distributed response), while accounting for spatial autocorrelation in model residuals: autocovariate regression; spatial eigenvector mapping; generalised least squares; (conditional and simultaneous) autoregressive models and generalised estimating equations. A comprehensive comparison of the relative merits of these methods is beyond the scope of this paper. To demonstrate each method's implementation, however, we undertook preliminary tests based on simulated data. These preliminary tests verified that most of the spatial modeling techniques we examined showed good type I error control and precise parameter estimates, at least when confronted with simplistic simulated data containing spatial autocorrelation in the errors. However, we found that for presence/absence data the results and conclusions were very variable between the different methods. This is likely due to the low information content of binary maps. Also, in contrast with previous studies, we found that autocovariate methods consistently underestimated the effects of environmental controls of species distributions. Given their widespread use, in particular for the modelling of species presence/absence data (e.g. climate envelope models), we argue that this warrants further study and caution in their use. To aid other ecologists in making use of the methods described, code to implement them in freely available software is provided in an electronic appendix. {\textcopyright} Ecography.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}With increasing interest in on-farm experiments, there is a pressing need to develop rigorous statistical methods for analysing these experiments. The adoption of advanced technologies such as yield monitors and variable-rate fertilizer applicators has enabled farmers and researchers to collect biophysical data linked to spatial information at a scale which allows them to investigate the role of spatial variability in the development of optimum management practices. A relevant topic for investigation could be: "what are the optimum rates of nitrogen and how/why do these differ across the field"? Although it has been recently understood that traditional statistical methods that are appropriate for analysing small-plot experiments are inappropriate for answering these questions, a unifying approach to inference for on-farm experiments is still missing and this limits the adoption of the technique. In this paper we propose a unifying approach to the analysis of on-farm strip experiments adapting the core ideas of local likelihood or geographically weighted regression. We propose a statistical model that allows spatial nonstationarity in modelled relationships and estimates spatially-varying parameters governing these relationships. A crucial step is bandwidth selection in implementing these models, and we develop bandwidth selection methods for two important scenarios relevant to the modelling of yield monitor data in on-farm experiments. Local {\textless}em{\textgreater}t{\textless}/em{\textgreater}-scores have been introduced for inferential purposes and the associated problem of multiple testing has been described in the context of analysing on-farm experiments. We demonstrate in this paper how local {\textless}em{\textgreater}p{\textless}/em{\textgreater}-values can be adjusted to overcome this problem. To illustrate the applicability of our proposed method, we analysed two publicly available datasets. Graphical displays are created to guide practitioners to make informed decisions on optimal management practices.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {A systematic comparison between two cultivar evaluation and recommendation systems, i.e., the balanced and replicated performance trials conducted in small plots at a small number of locations, and the unbalanced and non-replicated on-farm trials conducted in large strips on many farms, is lacking. This study was initiated to investigate the usefulness of the two contrasting systems in cultivar evaluation and the relationships between them. Yield data from Ontario winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) strip trials and performance trials for 1998 to 2000 were analyzed by mixed models. For all 3 yr, results from the two systems were highly correlated, both in terms of the best linear unbiased predictors (BLUP) and for the t-values of BLUP. Cultivars judged to be superior (or inferior) by one system were never judged to be inferior (or superior) by the other. Thus, both on-farm strip trials and replicated small-plot trials provide valid data for effective cultivar evaluation. On the basis of t-statistics, which measure cultivar reliability, cultivars can be classified into superior (t ≥ 2), inferior (t ≤ -2), and intermediate or inadequately tested (-2 {\textless} t {\textless} 2). Two cultivars can be regarded as different in reliability if their t-values differ by ≥3. The evaluation power of strip trials for a cultivar depends on the number of trials in which the cultivar is tested; a cultivar may not be adequately evaluated if it is tested in fewer than 20 trials.},

abstract = {In designed experiments and in particular longitudinal studies, the aim may be to assess the effect of a quantitative variable such as time on treatment effects. Modelling treatment effects can be complex in the presence of other sources of variation. Three examples are presented to illustrate an approach to analysis in such cases. The first example is a longitudinal experiment on the growth of cows under a factorial treatment structure where serial correlation and variance heterogeneity complicate the analysis. The second example involves the calibration of optical density and the concentration of a protein DNase in the presence of sampling variation and variance heterogeneity. The final example is a multienvironment agricultural field experiment in which a yield-seeding rate relationship is required for several varieties of lupins. Spatial variation within environments, heterogeneity between environments and variation between varieties all need to be incorporated in the analysis. In this paper, the cubic smoothing spline is used in conjunction with fixed and random effects, random coefficients and variance modelling to provide simultaneous modelling of trends and covariance structure. The key result that allows coherent and flexible empirical model building in complex situations is the linear mixed model representation of the cubic smoothing spline. An extension is proposed in which trend is partitioned into smooth and non-smooth components. Estimation and inference, the analysis of the three examples and a discussion of extensions and unresolved issues are also presented.},

abstract = {Confirming the precision agriculture hypothesis for variable-rate N applications (VRAs) is challenging. To confront this challenge, researchers have used increasingly sophisticated statistical models to estimate and compare site-specific crop response functions (SSCRFs). While progress has been made, it has been hampered by the lack of a conceptual framework to guide the development of appropriate statistical models. This paper provides such a framework and demonstrates its utility by developing a heteroscedastic, fixed and random effects, geostatistical model to test if VRA can increase N returns. The novelty of the model is the inclusion of site, spatial, treatment, and treatment strip heteroscedasticity and correlation. Applied to data collected in 1995 from two corn (Zea mays L.) N response experiments in south-central Minnesota, results demonstrate the importance of including site, spatial, treatment, and treatment strip effects in the estimation of SSCRFs. Results also indicate a significant potential for VRA to increase N returns and that these potential returns increase as the area of the management unit decreases. At one location, there was greater than a 95{\%} chance that VRA could have increased profitability if the cost of implementing VRA was less than {\$}14.5 ha -1.

Based on the results from the simulated data we can conclude that the REML estimates are accurate but the mode of posterior distributions from the Gibbs sampling can be overestimated depending on the level of the heritability. The mean and median of the posteriors were considerably higher than the expected values of the heritabilities. The confidence intervals calculated with the delta method were biased downwardly. The highest probability density (HPD) interval provides a better interval estimate, but could be slightly biased at the lower level. Similar differences between REML and Gibbs sampling estimates were found for the Scots pine data.

abstract = {Multivariate analysis is preferred over univariate analysis in plant breeding studies because it can exploit correlated traits and environments, whereas Bayesian analysis provides a natural way to incorporate prior knowledge and inferences that are conditional on the observed data. The objective of this paper is to show how to use multivariate Bayesian analysis for estimating random effects of genotype × environment and genotype × environment × trait combinations, and for computing genotypic and phenotypic correlations among traits and environments. Data were collected from on-farm trials conducted by the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIM-MYT) to evaluate bread and durum wheat lines in the Yaqui Valley of southern Sonora, M{\'{e}}xico, during three crop seasons (2012, 2013, and 2015). The Bayesian multi-trait and multi-environment model with Gibbs sampler provides an analytic solution that can be used as an alternative for analyzing on-farm multiple-trait and multiple-environment data because it allows making parsimonious, precise and simultaneous estimations of random effects, genetic correlations (of traits and environments) and residual correlations of traits. The multivariate Bayesian model successfully fitted three of the four data sets (2012, 2015, and combined cropping seasons), but did not fit well the data of crop season 2013. For three out of five traits under study in this crop season, the correlations between the observed and predicted phenotypic values were lower than 0.6, suggesting that the predicted values were not very close to the observed values.},

abstract = {Key message: Established spatial models improve the analysis of agricultural field trials with or without genomic data and can be fitted with the open-source R package INLA. Abstract: The objective of this paper was to fit different established spatial models for analysing agricultural field trials using the open-source R package INLA. Spatial variation is common in field trials, and accounting for it increases the accuracy of estimated genetic effects. However, this is still hindered by the lack of available software implementations. We compare some established spatial models and show possibilities for flexible modelling with respect to field trial design and joint modelling over multiple years and locations. We use a Bayesian framework and for statistical inference the integrated nested Laplace approximations (INLA) implemented in the R package INLA. The spatial models we use are the well-known independent row and column effects, separable first-order autoregressive (AR 1 ⊗ AR 1) models and a Gaussian random field (Mat{\'{e}}rn) model that is approximated via the stochastic partial differential equation approach. The Mat{\'{e}}rn model can accommodate flexible field trial designs and yields interpretable parameters. We test the models in a simulation study imitating a wheat breeding programme with different levels of spatial variation, with and without genome-wide markers and with combining data over two locations, modelling spatial and genetic effects jointly. The results show comparable predictive performance for both the AR 1 ⊗ AR 1 and the Mat{\'{e}}rn models. We also present an example of fitting the models to a real wheat breeding data and simulated tree breeding data with the Nelder wheel design to show the flexibility of the Mat{\'{e}}rn model and the R package INLA.},

@article{Burkner2018Advanced,
abstract = {The brms package allows R users to easily specify a wide range of Bayesian single-level and multilevel models which are fit with the probabilistic programming language Stan behind the scenes. Several response distributions are supported, of which all parameters (e.g., location, scale, and shape) can be predicted. Non-linear relationships may be specified using non-linear predictor terms or semi-parametric approaches such as splines or Gaussian processes. Multivariate models can be fit as well. To make all of these modeling options possible in a multilevel framework, brms provides an intuitive and powerful formula syntax, which extends the well known formula syntax of lme4. The purpose of the present paper is to introduce this syntax in detail and to demonstrate its usefulness with four examples, each showing relevant aspects of the syntax.},

Further modeling options include autocorrelation of the response variable, user defined covariance structures, censored data, as well as meta-analytic standard errors. Prior specifications are flexible and explicitly encourage users to apply prior distributions that actually reflect their beliefs. In addition, model fit can easily be assessed and compared with the Watanabe-Akaike information criterion and leave-one-out cross-validation.},

@article{Chen2019Asimple,
abstract = {Yield prediction is a major determinant of many management decisions for crop production. Farmers and their advisors want user-friendly decision support tools for predicting yield. Simulation models can be used to accurately predict yield, but they are complex and difficult to parameterise. The goal of this study is to build a simple and parsimonious model for predicting wheat yields that can be implemented in a decision tool to be used by farmers at a paddock level. A large yield data set accumulated from trials on commonly grown varieties in Western Australia is used to build and validate a generalised additive model (GAM) for predicting wheat yield. Explanatory variables tested included weather data and derivatives, geolocation, soil type, land capability, and wheat varieties. Model selection followed a forward stepwise approach in combination with cross-validation to select the smallest set of explanatory variables. The predictive performance is also evaluated using independent data. The final model uses seasonal water availability, location and year to predict wheat yield. Because the GAM model has minimal inputs, it can be easily employed in a decision tool to predict yield throughout the growing season using rainfall data up to the prediction date and either climatological averages or seasonal forecasts of rainfall for the remainder of the growing season. It also has the potential to be used as an input to agronomic models that predict the effect on yield of various management choices for fertiliser, pest, weed and disease management.},

We choose Stan (rather than WinBUGS or JAGS) because it provides an elegant and scalable framework for fitting models in most of the standard applications of LMMs. We ease the reader into fitting increasingly complex LMMs, first using a two-condition repeated measures self-paced reading study, followed by a more complex {\$}2\backslashtimes 2{\$} repeated measures factorial design that can be generalized to much more complex designs.},
