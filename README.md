This is my blog repository. Being a statistician and Bayesian, I would like to share my expertise and knowledge with everyone who is interested in applied statistics and on the pathway to a data scientiest. 


I am using the Jekyll templates `minima`, which can be found at `https://github.com/jekyll/minima`.

Thanks to the author for developing this awesome template.
